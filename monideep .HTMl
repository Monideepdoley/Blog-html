    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has leapt from science-fiction novels into our daily lives, quietly powering everything from the recommendations in our streaming services to critical decisions in medicine and finance. In this blog, we’ll dive deep into how AI is used across industries, explore the compelling advantages it offers, and shine a light on the challenges and ethical concerns it brings.
      From voice assistants that understand natural language to self-driving cars navigating complex environments, AI is transforming the way we interact with technology. Its ability to analyze vast amounts of data and detect patterns has made it a crucial tool in sectors like healthcare, agriculture, cybersecurity, and beyond.
    
    However, with great power comes great responsibility. As AI systems grow more autonomous, questions around privacy, bias, job displacement, and accountability have become more pressing than ever. Understanding these issues is key to using AI not just intelligently—but ethically.

    <h2>1. What Is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
    <p>At its core, AI is a branch of computer science that creates systems capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence—things like learning, reasoning, perception, and language understanding. Through techniques such as machine learning, neural networks, and natural language processing, AI “learns” patterns in data and uses them to make predictions or take actions.</p>
